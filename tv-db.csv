Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, womenâ€¦and, surprisingly, children. This eraâ€™s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picardâ€™s crew enjoys many of the comforts theyâ€™d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, â€œreplicatedâ€ food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind. However, the ongoing mission â€“ no longer limited to a mere five years â€“ remains virtually the same as it was during Kirkâ€™s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.",7+,8.6/10,86/100,1,1,1,0
